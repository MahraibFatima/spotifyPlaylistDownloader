## Spotify Playlist Downloader ðŸŽµ

This is a Py-based command-line program that allows you to download songs from a public Spotify playlist in **.mp3 format**. It combines the power of Spotify's API, YouTube search, and FFmpeg to fetch songs and save them locally in a folder named after the playlist.
